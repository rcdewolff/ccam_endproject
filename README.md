# CCAM End project

This repo was used to do some calculations for the final project of the Climate Change, Adaptation and Mitigation. Not all datasets were used, as some were used to just try some things that didn't work out. The last two code blocks of `occ_endproject.ipynb` were used to calculate the information used in the final report.
